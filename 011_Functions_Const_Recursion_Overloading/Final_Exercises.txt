1) Create const variables for an int, char, string, and double

2) Create const pointers for an int, char, double (so that addess cannot change)

3) Create an inline function that takes in a const int reference, has a precondition of it being greater than 0 and returns 5 more than that value

4) Create a const int const pointer set to 5

5) Create an inline function that takes in a const string const pointer and has a postcondition that ensures the string is not empty

6) Create constexpr variables for an int, char, string, double

7) Create a function that creates a constexpr variable within it, but does nothing with it

8) Create a recursive function that removes a letter from a string, then returns the reverse of the string

9) Create overloaded inline functions for subtracting 1, 2 and 3 numbers away from the first number passed in
