1) Create a for loop that prints out 0-10

2) Create a for loop that prints out 0-100, but only even numbers

3) Create a for loop that prints out 0-100, but only odd numbers

4) Create a while loop that outputs a char array with one less character everytime it loops until it holds only '\0' values within it. Use strlen() to get the size of the array. (edited) 

5) Create a do while loop that only executes once

6) Create a nested for loop within another that prints out the product of each iterator ranging from 0-10, creating a times table for 0-100 (HINT: use 'printf("%03d ", i*j);' for output with proper spacing between each item, instead of "cout << i*j << ' ';".)
