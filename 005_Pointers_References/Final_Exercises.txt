1) Create 5 different variables of different data types. Output each their values and addresses

2) Create 5 different variables of different data types. Create 5 different 

3) Create 3 different variables of the same data type. Create 3 reference variables to those types and store them in an array. Output the values in the array.

4) Create a char variable and output its value using both & and * in front of it.

5) Create 3 different variables of different data types and 3 pointers which point to each of those. Then output the pointers values

6) Create a one int array. Output the value within the array using both the [0] and the * methods.

7) Create a 5 item array. Output each of the address of the items by adding ints to the original array variable

8) Create a pointer that points to an array of five ints. Then output to see the current value it's pointing to (using cout and *). Then on the next line use the increment operator (++) on the pointer. Finally output it's value again.


- Create a pointer that points to the last item in a five int array. Output the value at its address. Then use the Decrement operator (--) to go up the array by one item. Finally, output the value at the pointers new address.
